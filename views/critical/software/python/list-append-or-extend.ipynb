    "I was in computer science class, attending a lecture involving Python list operations, when a classmate posed a very interesting question.  \n",
    "To quote directly, \"*Wouldn't extend be a better choice instead of append, since extend allows you to insert multiple variables into a list while append only allows for one? Or are there cases where append would be more suitable?*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I will admit to having never heard of nor needed to use the `#list.extend()` function before this situation. Hence, it is of personal benefit to me, too, to resolve this question, as it may provide insight into an uncommon feature of Python and its usages.  \n",
    "As such, this document will discuss and review that question systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that in this instance superiority is weighed on a metric of performance, in both operational expense and time to execute.  \n",
    "To ensure fairness and equality of testing, each list will end with the same number of elements, so the number of operations will equate to the base number (I am using 1 million as the base number for this series of tests) divided by the number of elements we are concatenating."

    "Logically, it seems likely that `#list.extend()` will only be more efficient in situations where more than one element is present. That will be my first hypothesis: for all singular concatenation operations, `#list.append()` will be superior by our metrics.  \n",
    "A derivative second hypothesis arises from this: For all concatenation operations involving more than one element, `#list.extend()` will be superior by our metrics.  \n",
    "And, finally, my last hypothesis is that traditional list concatenation, as in `list1 + list2` syntax, should result to be superior to `#list.extend()` by our metrics."

For this reason I actually had to comment out the concatenation tests to prevent them from halting the rendering of the notebook, however if you wish to verify my claims, I have left them in the code so you can run the test suite yourself on any Python-3 supportive IPy, Jupyter or other kernel.  \n",

    "- `#list.append()` is faster than `#list.extend()` for single-element operations\n",
    "- `#list.extend()` is faster than `#list.append()` inversely proportional to the number of elements for all others\n",
    "- `list1 + list2` syntax is faster than both for small lists, but gets very performance expensive when working with large lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this information, I conclude that `#list.extend()` should be preferred in instances where multiple elements are to be added at the same time, and `#list.append()` should be preferred in instances where the number of elements is unknown or they are to be added iteratively instead of simultaneously.  \n",
