# Critical Views
Inspired by the good folks of [cat -v](http://cat-v.org), this document series
aims to challenge standardisation in favour of ascertaining the best
methodology for future scientific innovations. My main focus, of course, as a
computer scientist, is computer science; however, that is not to say I will not
explore other fields.

It is worth noting that this is done in the style of CH (Considered Harmful)
essays, done right. I believe that their purpose should not be to inflame debate
or spread unnecessarily biased views, but rather to outline exactly why a
particular modus operandi or entity is detrimental, be it in specific use cases
or in general.

Bias is against my core values. I strive only to provide my viewpoints on the
topics at hand, coupled with my reasoning, testing and evidence as to why I
hold that particular stance, in order to ensure fair reasoning.

Therefore, I vow with this document not to withhold or cherrypick any of my
findings intentionally to misrepresent or inflame a particular cause, and to
provide nothing less than my full findings and conclusions, in the interest of
proper research science.

## Post scriptum
My personal thanks go to Robert Pike for inspiring me to take up a pursuit of
broader academics and sciences beyond the computing industry, and the folks
from Bell Labs behind [Plan 9](https://9p.io/plan9) and eventually 9front for
inspiring me to look beyond the state of modern computer science.
