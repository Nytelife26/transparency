# Preface

This is a collective document for all of my beliefs and values. They are things
I believe to best align with reality and be the most accurate (*last updated
04:52 UTC, 18/03/2021*).

If you have an alternative perspective you believe I may not have considered, or
anything you wish to discuss, please reach out to me. I am open-minded and love
nothing more than to learn new things or to accept my wrongdoings and align my
worldviews closer to reality.

Of course, I am only human. I may not always be correct, however I promise to
both myself and the rest of humanity that I will never swallow my morals for
monetary or societal gain and will always do my best to correct my mistakes and
strive to be better.

I would also like to forewarn you that I do not identify with any commonly used
political terms or labels. All of them have stigmas attached and I think the
negativity associated with them creates a face-value bias. As I would like to be
judged on my values, rather than how people label them generally when those
labels could never tell you my individual viewpoints, I will not use them nor
will I tolerate other people using them in summary or to detract from my
statements.

# Part One - Tradition and Conservation

I have always believed tradition to hold no real bearing or value. Simply put,
doing things solely because that's how they were done historically is a very
irrational way to operate. Tradition is the antithesis of evolution. If you have
two cars, one is old and starting to become out of specification for modern
automotive travel, and a newer one which performs better, would you pick the old
car because you've had it for longer or the newer one because it is objectively
superior?

Clinging to old methodologies and values solely because they're old is a poor
excuse to avoid changing for the better. You should strive to align yourself to
reality as closely as possible, for anything else is the denial of evolution and
a roadblock both individually and to us as a species.

# Part Two - Politics

## Section A - Election Propaganda

I believe these things truly speak for themselves. A large majority of campaigns
are slanderous or negative against other campaigns. It strikes me, however, that
substituting the ability to provide reasons for yourself for reasons against the
other candidates is a brilliant way to ensure a lower chance of any candidates
actually having positive attributes.

Candidates should be promoting themselves (truthfully) rather than defiling
the image of others. You should never perpetuate propaganda, you should always
perpetuate useful information.

This ties into the political habit of lying. Many politicians have gone back on
their promises historically and will continue to do so. This is highly
ineffective and promotes an environment where people say what society wants to
hear in order to get into power and then do whatever they wish once they have
the chair. It is a selfish notion and one that is greatly harmful to society.

## Section B - Imperialism

Imperialism presents itself in many forms. I will discuss the primary ones here.

**Militarisation and Colonialism:**
As a nation, it is always wrong to forcefully occupy another nation without good
reason - such as the only example I can think of, if occupation were necessary
for the greater good of both parties, for instance in the case of an actively
growing terrorist threat that becomes a threat to both nations and the subject
nation does not have the power to cope alone.

That, however, is occupation, or potentially able to be considered a
protectorate. The concept of colonialism for any reason, especially cultural
erasure or exploitation, will never be rational nor acceptable.

**Monetary and Influential:**
Using a greater access to wealth and influence to coerce a population of any
size into a weaker position for the purpose of forcing its hand in an agreement
or making occupation easier is almost as bad as the occupation itself, due to
there being typically no gain for the offending nation, and the subject nation
suffering in terms of livelihood of its citizens and their access to resources.

**Conclusion:**
The forceful takeover of another population in any way opposes all rationality
or kin empathy. It is counter productive due to providing no overall benefit to
humanity and instead halting the progress of a subject nation for decades or
centuries to come or potentially erasing parts of people's livelihoods and
culture. There is no way to justify ruining lives for personal gain.

## Section C - Foreign Affairs

It is proven time and time again that humanity operates at its best when we work
together. For this reason, the only need for military intervention is to protect
the wellbeing of innocent people from threats to human life, such as terrorism.

Economically speaking, trade deals are to be encouraged and worked towards. If
both parties can benefit from a deal, there is no reason to decline. If either
end of a trade deal is operating with selfish nature, the other party
should objectively decline with good reason. What is the purpose of exchange of
any resource or information if not to benefit those involved to some degree?

As for human rights, see part 5, as preserving human rights in foreign nations
is as important as preserving human rights anywhere in the world.

## Section D - Electorates

Having a party divide system is outdated. It solely serves to continue the same
bias as I mentioned in the preface regarding political umbrella terms, and
encourages people to vote for parties solely because traditionally them or
their families have voted that way rather than considering individual candidates
for their values and goals.

Candidates should run independently of party system. Each candidate should
present their core values and goals as a statement of intent to the public at
the beginning so people can evaluate for themselves what they think would work
best, and once again before the final election series to allow for candidates to
refine their earlier statements and build upon what they have said, as well as a
round of open public questioning to answer any questions citizens may have.

Then, when the time comes, when citizens vote they should be presented with the
list of candidates and their stated goals and premises as a reminder so they
can make an educated and fair decision on who they feel would do best for
their country and for humanity.

# Part Three - Economics

## Section A - Campaign Finance

Private donors should be largely discouraged. A candidate's ability to reach
the masses should not be hindered nor amplified by the powers backing them, but
rather by their quality as a candidate.

To keep things fair, each candidate should be allotted an equal amount for their
campaign from public election donations and state funding.

## Section B - Taxes and Wealth Distribution

Tax bands are a demonstrably ineffective way to approach this situation. They
are too widely distributed and put strain on finances people worked to gain.
The only acceptable allocation of public tax is purposes that benefit the
public - and, arguably, if what the government is doing does not benefit the
public, they should not be doing it, for it is an ineffective drain on tax
capital.

Taxes are necessary to some extent to provide a functioning capital system to
hold the nation's infrastructure together under an economic value driven
societal model. However, they should be more scalar with people's earnings to
compensate for the vast difference in people's earnings.

I would also like to introduce a concept that I am not sure exists yet or has
been trialled - public funding appeals. Instead of raising or decreasing taxes
to allow the government's budget to include other projects, these alternative
projects that are not core to the nation's operations should be held as a public
funding appeal, whereby the government makes an appeal to citizens along with
the intentions of the project to seek public opt-in funding. I believe this
would be a much more effective solution to expensive projects currently ran off
of tax capital, allowing people that can afford to dedicate extra resources
to helping for the potential greater good to do so, and leaving those that
cannot to contribute only to what is necessary.

I am aware, however, that not all tax comes from workers. Import and product
value taxes also exist, along with many others. However, when you tax businesses
for the money received from clients, and you tax the clients for their earnings,
where is the benefit created in applying tax to the products too? Both sides
already contribute, so adding more tax as an intermediary just creates product
price inflation. This is backed by the fact that according to research done by
the Tax Policy Center based on figures from the Office of Management and Budget
"Receipts by Source" (1950-2019), "exercise tax" (goods and services tax)
generates less than 3% of all tax revenue. This is smaller than any other kind
of measured tax, and so poses no harm if it is to be removed, meanwhile allowing
citizens to enjoy better prices on goods and services to increase their quality
of living.

## Section C - Social Support

A large part of the problem in terms of social support related policies are
expenses. They put a large strain on taxes, given that 36% (same source cited in
section B) of all tax revenue is for social insurance. However, looking at
European countries such as the United Kingdom, such policies are very much
feasible.

The United Kingdom's public healthcare system is far superior to privatized.
Public healthcare enables taxpayers to seek government provided healthcare
if necessary, with the drawback that service may be slower or less cutting
edge than private healthcare businesses due to less available resources and
workforce. This creates a standard to stop private healthcare businesses from
raising extortionate prices against their clients, and so enables them to
operate safely alongside the public sector so other firms can offer state of the
art specialized care to cover for procedures that may take too long or not yet
be possible if done via public funding. This is one of the most economically
sufficient and publicly usable systems devised worldwide by those metrics.

Alongside this, the war on drugs has ensued for too long. Imprisoning people for
usage of drugs is ineffective in a society with declining psychological
wellbeing. It is unfair to punish people for needing to resort to unhealthy
coping mechanisms. We do not treat the mentally ill by throwing them in a cell,
so why should we treat addicts that way? Instead, it would be prevalent to refer
them to rehabilitation schemes. This was the technique adopted by Norway and
Finland, countries previously suffering from drug crises regarding heroin and
other illegal substances - they implemented rehabilitation schemes for the
addicted rather than sentencing and encouraged people to come forward. This is
the most humane solution and also puts much less strain on the economy and
prison system than incarcerating them, freeing up space for the criminally
dangerous to be dealt with rather than wasting resources on an ineffective
deterrent from drug use.
