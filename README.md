# Transparency is Crucial.

I, Tyler J. Russell (or Nytelife26 on the internet), firmly hold that as one of
my core values. As such, I am making this repository to audit my personal
endeavours for the viewership of anyone who wishes to perceive or judge my
personal life and works.

As such, I pledge, from the time I am writing this (18:27 UTC, 16/11/2020)
onwards, that I will do and engage in nothing I do not wish to be held
accountable for, to take responsibility for all my works, and to publish
any of my works or findings here for free, as in freedom ***and*** price,
with no exception.

Let this be the declaration that marks my commitment to openness, honesty, and
absolute transparency as my core operational values. No business I engage in
shall ever be separate from these values, and anyone that tries to restrict them
has or ever will have any respect in my eyes.
