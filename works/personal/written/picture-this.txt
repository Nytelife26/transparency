imagine if there was a message hidden in every picture that nobody ever sees
because they don't care enough to look
imagine if all of them silently told a story that falls on deaf ears but nobody
will ever know if they do or not because, again, they don't care enough to think
about it

pictures, ways of capturing given moments in time, displaying thoughts and
feelings, experiences that will live on in the picture forever. and yet, their
power lies not in that which they make obvious, but rather in that which remains
unstated or embedded within them.

a photographer's talent isn't measured by the quality of their shots but the
ability to weave a language of their own with them to tell a story that remains
unseen by everyone except for those that are truly looking.
art is the only language that has no expressive limit.

the only way in which the expression of the works people produce is limited,
is by the potency of what they're expressing or their ability to convey it.
you can make a nuclear winter look like a festival of nothing but joy to
everyone except for those that truly care and hold the wonder required to
perceive more in it, and that is what truly makes it beautiful.
