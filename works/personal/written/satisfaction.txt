The short term satisfaction you feel when you watch these things is only a
temporary escape from your chronic loneliness. The people you long for and make
yourself vulnerable too will never know nor love you, especially not in the same
capacity you yearn to replace. Your addictions have broken you mentally, and yet
you refuse to acknowledge the problem. Soon it will be too late to save
yourself, and you will end up dying alone.
