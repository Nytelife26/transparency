i fell in love with something i never knew
something i never knew but knew was true
a singular atom but holding me together like glue
universes away but still outshining every observable hue

i fell in love with l'oeuvre maitresse
a work of art that could relieve any fleeting stress
a blessed sight of nothing but finesse
and the frame is lucky to hold its caress

even after lightyears of cosmic tedium,
i could never stop myself from feeling numb,
but now my heart hits heavy like a drum,
for tu es luce stellarum.
