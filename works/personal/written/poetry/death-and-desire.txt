she cries the tears you said you wouldn't need
because when she was in her time of need
all you did was cut her and make her bleed
so she would never leave

but now all she wants is to walk away
because you never gave her the time of day
and she talks all day
to her friends in a state of disarray

about how much she wishes she didn't need you
about how through and through
although infatuated she knows your "love" will kill her too
and it's true

a fleeting, faded memory...
that's all she needs to see
to know that you'll be there
you'll care
or so you'll say, hoping she doesn't notice the knife while you stroke her hair,
right?
