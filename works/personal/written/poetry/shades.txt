Twenty shades of me and you,
Love it seems, and beautiful in every hue,
A vibrant dream where entropy is broken and our bond is true,
Do you feel like the stars align between me and you?

Twenty shades of me and you,
Pulled apart at the seams, yet fused between every hue,
A technicolor dance of crimson and blue,
Whatever happened to me and you?

Twenty shades of me and you,
Pulled apart at the seams, and opposing polarities in everything new,
A vibrant dream of the past, now monochrome and drowned out in pure static and blue,
Whatever happened to me and you?
