What do you get from watching their most intimate action?
A fleeting moment of embracing satisfaction?
Your life has crumbled, a clear liquefaction
of everything that ever made sense to you, so what's your reaction?

You seek a temporarily shelter.
One that makes you feel like you could melt her,
but in reality, you've never even felt her,
and if you could...
What's point in wishful thinking when you'll never make that kind of delta?

Your addiction has broken you down, my friend,
and ultimately you won't acknowledge, nor tend,
to the scars they left you with, so that's how you'll meet your end.
Alone, afraid, and with nothing but a fleeting satisfaction to help you mend.
