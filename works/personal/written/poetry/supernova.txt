There is no single verse,
that could express truly you're the magnum opus of the universe,
and I know you'll never see it like I do,
but ultimately all those stars will never be prettier than you.

We're all interstellar graveyards,
and you might forget that when life gets hard,
but you don't need to think like I do,
to see that iridescent cosmic history lives on proudly in you.

You look at the art and see imperfections,
while I piece it all together and see perfection,
and I hope you can see it like I do,
because nothing else could even hope to shine brighter than you.

I'm sure they'll love you.
And if they don't then I will,
forever and always,
through and through.
