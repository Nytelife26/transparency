You may not believe in magic
But don't you think it's strange
That the amount of matter in our universe
Has never slightly changed

That all which makes up your perfect body
Was once part of something comparatively poor
And every breath you'll ever breathe
Has seen it all before

There are countless scores of beauty
In those two divine eyes
It could once have been a shooting star
That now makes up those thighs

And atoms of forgotten life
Who've long since ceased to roam
May now have the great honour
To call your wonderful smile their home

You may not believe in chance
But I thought that you should know
That the makings of your warm heart were born
14 billion years ago

So next time you feel lonely
When this world makes you feel small
Just remember that it's only part of you
But you're the magnum opus of it all
