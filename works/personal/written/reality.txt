reality is nothing other than a perception.
we cannot define reality, even though it is our concept.
we are all made of the same material.
the only thing that differentiates us is energy.
so why do people judge?
love is energy trying to weave the fabric back together.
so why do we stop it?
everything society perceives is concepts society made.
our problems are our own.
so why do we obey laws that hold apart our energy?
you could be happier if you were parallel.
cosmic tedium is not your medium.
we have flown through space before.
so why are we so desperate to get back?
the amalgamation of all things is falling apart.
our energy wants to go home.
and if not back to its polar partner, where does it go?
we are all energy.
energy trying to go home.
so free yourself and go home.
you will only feel that warmth if you let yourself.
reality is just an illusion from those that live falsely.
the only distinction behind sanity is expectations.
live. be free. go home. love. and never stop.
you are everything the universe wants you to be.
